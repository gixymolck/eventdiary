Develop an application with the following features;

Register (First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Gender and Date of Birth). Don't allow the user to register if the age is under 18 years old.  
Login page

Please create a page where the logged in users can create events. Event form should include Event Name, Start Date and End Date. Then there should be an option for inviting people with their email into the event. Need an option to remove the invited users. Here you should use ajax.

Public event listing page (can be accessed without login) which will list all the events. It should include a pagination and search option (Single text input) which allows users to search different fields in the database. In addition to that add an option to search by date range. So all events happening between the selected period should be listed.Â 

Please create a public page where show the average events count created by the users. On the same page, another list should show the average of each user.
